# System Requirements Example

A comprehensive requirements documentation structure for a multi-service .NET platform following Self-Contained Systems (SCS) architecture patterns.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a professional approach to documenting requirements for a distributed platform consisting of multiple self-contained services. The structure supports both functional and non-functional requirements while maintaining clear separation of concerns across services.

## Architecture Approach

- **Self-Contained Systems (SCS)**: Each service owns its data, UI, and business logic
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services aligned with business domains
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through domain events
- **API-First Design**: Well-defined contracts between services
- **Cloud-Native**: Built for Azure with scalability and resilience

## Getting Started

### For Product Managers
1. Start with `01-system-overview.md` for business context
2. Review `02-system-capabilities.md` for feature planning
3. Examine `user-experience/user-journeys.md` for user story alignment

### For Architects
1. Review `04-integration-patterns.md` for service communication
2. Study `05-security-architecture.md` for security patterns
3. Examine service-specific requirements in `services/` folder

### For Developers
1. Start with `services/shared-contracts/` for common patterns
2. Review individual service requirements for implementation details
3. Follow `cross-cutting/` guidelines for consistent implementation

### For Operations Teams
1. Review `03-global-nfr.md` for performance and reliability requirements
2. Study `operations/` folder for deployment and maintenance procedures
3. Examine monitoring and alerting requirements

## Contributing

When adding new services or updating requirements:

1. **Use Consistent Structure**: Follow the established template patterns
2. **Maintain Traceability**: Link requirements to business objectives
3. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure shared contracts and integration points are updated
4. **Document Decisions**: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant choices
5. **Keep Current**: Regular reviews to ensure requirements remain aligned with implementation

## Benefits of This Approach
