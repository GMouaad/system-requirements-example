**Tablet Experience (768px - 1199px)**

- Touch-optimized interface with appropriate touch targets
- Adaptive layouts that work in both portrait and landscape
- Simplified navigation with collapsible sections
- Gesture support for natural tablet interactions

**Mobile Experience (320px - 767px)**

- Mobile-first design with core functionality prioritized
- Thumb-friendly navigation and interaction areas
- Streamlined forms with mobile input optimization
- Offline capability for essential functions

### Cross-Platform Consistency

**Unified Experience**

- Consistent core workflows across all device types

## Performance and Loading Strategies

### Perceived Performance

**Loading States**

- Skeleton screens for content areas during loading
- Progressive image loading with low-quality placeholders
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate user feedback
- Background data loading to minimize wait times

**Performance Optimization**

- Critical path rendering for above-the-fold content
- Lazy loading for non-critical resources and below-the-fold content
