# System Overview

## Purpose
This platform is designed to [describe the primary business purpose and value proposition]. The system enables [target users] to [key business outcomes] through a distributed architecture of self-contained services.

## Target Users
- **Primary Users**: End customers who interact directly with the platform
- **Secondary Users**: Administrative staff, support teams, and content managers
- **System Users**: External integrators, partner services, and automated systems
- **Technical Users**: Developers, DevOps teams, and system administrators

## Business Context
### Market Position
- Target market segment and competitive landscape
- Key differentiators and unique value propositions
- Business model and revenue streams

### Success Metrics
- User acquisition and retention targets
- Revenue and performance indicators
- Technical performance benchmarks
- Customer satisfaction goals

## High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a Self-Contained Systems (SCS) architecture pattern with the following key components:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │    │   API Gateway   │    │   Self-Contained│
│   Applications  │◄──►│   (YARP/Ocelot) │◄──►│   Systems (SCS) │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         │                       │                       │
         ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Identity &    │    │   Monitoring &  │    │   Event Bus &   │
│   Security      │    │   Observability │    │   Messaging     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Architectural Principles
1. **Self-Contained Systems**: Each service owns its data, UI, and business logic
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Services aligned with business domains
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through domain events
4. **API-First Design**: Well-defined contracts between services
5. **Cloud-Native**: Built for scalability and resilience

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Backend Framework**: .NET 8+ with ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: [To be defined based on requirements - React/Angular/Blazor]
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Container Orchestration**: Azure Container Apps or Azure Kubernetes Service
- **API Gateway**: YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) or Azure API Management

### Data & Storage
- **Primary Database**: Azure SQL Database for transactional data
- **Document Store**: Azure Cosmos DB for flexible schema requirements
- **Caching**: Azure Redis Cache for performance optimization
- **File Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for documents and media
- **Message Bus**: Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging

### DevOps & Monitoring
- **Source Control**: Git with GitHub/Azure DevOps
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights and Azure Monitor
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for secrets management

## System Boundaries

### What's In Scope
- Core business functionality across identified domains
- User management and authentication
- API gateway and service orchestration
- Monitoring and observability infrastructure
- Basic administrative interfaces

### What's Out of Scope (Initially)
- Advanced analytics and machine learning features
- Third-party marketplace integrations
- Mobile applications (web-responsive initially)
- Advanced workflow automation
- Multi-tenant architecture (single tenant initially)

## Key Assumptions
- Users have reliable internet connectivity
- Modern web browser support (latest 2 versions of major browsers)
- English language support initially (internationalization planned for future)
- Azure cloud infrastructure availability and reliability
- Team has .NET and Azure expertise
- Regulatory compliance requirements are limited initially

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use .NET ecosystem and Microsoft Azure
- Existing corporate security policies must be maintained
- Integration with existing Active Directory required
- Must support existing business processes during transition

### Business Constraints
- Limited budget for external services and third-party tools
- 12-month timeline for initial MVP release
- Phased rollout required to minimize business disruption
- Existing team skill set focused on .NET technologies

### Regulatory Constraints
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, regional requirements)
- Industry-specific compliance requirements
- Audit trail and data retention requirements
- Security standards and certifications needed

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
