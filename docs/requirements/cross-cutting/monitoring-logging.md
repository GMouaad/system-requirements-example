# Monitoring and Logging Requirements

## Observability Strategy

### Monitoring Philosophy

The platform implements comprehensive observability through the three pillars of monitoring: metrics, logs, and traces. This enables proactive issue detection, rapid troubleshooting, and data-driven optimization decisions.

**Core Principles**:
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect issues before users experience them
- **Full Stack Visibility**: Monitor from user experience down to infrastructure
- **Actionable Alerts**: Every alert must have a clear response action
- **Business Context**: Technical metrics tied to business impact
- **Cost Awareness**: Monitoring overhead balanced with operational value

### Observability Stack

**Cloud-Native Observability Tools**:
- **OpenTelemetry**: Unified observability framework for metrics, logs, and traces
- **Prometheus**: Time-series metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Dashboards, visualization, and alerting
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing and performance monitoring
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and analysis
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notification management

**CNCF Ecosystem Integration**:
- **Kubernetes**: Native service discovery and health checks
- **Helm**: Observability stack deployment and configuration
- **Istio/Linkerd**: Service mesh observability and traffic metrics
- **Fluentd/Fluent Bit**: Log collection and forwarding

## Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

### Response Time Monitoring

**API Response Times**:
- Track 50th, 95th, and 99th percentile response times
- Monitor by endpoint, service, and user segment
- Alert on 95th percentile exceeding SLA thresholds
- Track response time trends and degradation patterns

**Database Performance**:
- Monitor query execution times and connection pool utilization
- Track slow queries with execution plans
- Monitor deadlocks, timeouts, and connection failures
- Alert on query performance degradation

**External Dependencies**:
- Monitor third-party API response times and availability
- Track circuit breaker state changes and fallback usage
- Monitor file storage operations and CDN performance
- Alert on dependency failures affecting user experience

### Throughput and Capacity Monitoring

**Request Volume**:
- Track requests per second by service and endpoint
- Monitor peak usage patterns and capacity utilization
- Alert on unusual traffic spikes or drops
- Capacity planning based on growth trends

**Resource Utilization**:
- CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization per service
- Container resource usage and scaling metrics
- Database connection pool and storage utilization
- Alert on resource exhaustion and scaling events

### Error Rate Monitoring

**Application Errors**:
- Track error rates by service, endpoint, and error type
- Monitor 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes separately
- Alert on error rate spikes above baseline thresholds
- Error categorization by severity and impact

**Business Logic Errors**:
- Track domain-specific error conditions
- Monitor validation failures and business rule violations
- Track compensation and retry success rates
- Alert on critical business process failures

## Structured Logging Standards

### Log Format Specification

**Standard Log Entry Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-23T10:30:00.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "UserService.Controllers.AuthController",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "requestId": "req_123456789",
  "correlationId": "corr_abc123def456",
  "traceId": "trace_xyz789",
  "userId": "usr_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "serviceVersion": "1.2.3",
  "environment": "production",
  "properties": {
    "operation": "login",
    "loginMethod": "password",
    "clientIp": "192.168.1.100",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "duration": 245
  },
  "tags": ["authentication", "security"]
}
```

### Log Levels and Usage

**TRACE**: Detailed diagnostic information for debugging
- Function entry/exit with parameters
- Detailed state information during processing
- Only enabled in development and troubleshooting scenarios

**DEBUG**: General debugging information
- Variable values and intermediate calculations
- Configuration values and environment information
- Enabled in development and staging environments

**INFO**: General application flow and business events
- User actions and business process completion
- Service startup/shutdown and configuration changes
- Always enabled in all environments

**WARN**: Potentially harmful situations that don't stop processing
- Fallback execution due to service unavailability
- Configuration issues with default values applied
- Deprecated API usage and feature warnings

**ERROR**: Error events that don't stop application execution
- Handled exceptions with recovery actions
- Business rule violations and validation failures
- External service failures with fallback responses

**FATAL**: Very severe error events that may cause application termination
- Unhandled exceptions that crash the application
- Critical resource unavailability (database, essential services)
- Security violations requiring immediate attention

### Sensitive Data Handling

**Data Classification in Logs**:
- **Never Log**: Passwords, tokens, credit card numbers, SSNs
- **Hash Before Logging**: Email addresses, phone numbers (when needed)
- **Redact Personal Data**: Names, addresses should be masked or excluded
- **Business Data**: Non-personal business data can be logged with appropriate retention

**PII Protection Patterns**:
```json
{
  "message": "User profile updated",
  "userId": "usr_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "email": "u***@example.com",
  "profileFields": ["firstName", "lastName", "bio"],
  "changeCount": 3
}
```

### Distributed Tracing

**OpenTelemetry Implementation**:

- **Trace Context Propagation**: W3C Trace Context standard for cross-service correlation
- **Automatic Instrumentation**: HTTP, gRPC, database, and message queue operations
- **Custom Instrumentation**: Business process boundaries and critical operations
- **Sampling Strategy**: Intelligent sampling based on operation criticality and error rates
- **Export Targets**: Jaeger for analysis, Prometheus for metrics aggregation

### Trace Context Propagation

**Correlation Identifiers**:
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for entire user request journey
- **Span ID**: Unique identifier for individual service operation
- **Correlation ID**: Business process identifier across multiple requests
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for single HTTP request

**HTTP Header Standards**:
```
X-Trace-Id: trace_abc123def456
X-Correlation-Id: corr_business_process_789
X-Request-Id: req_123456789
X-User-Id: usr_123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```

### Span Instrumentation

**Automatic Instrumentation**:
- HTTP requests and responses (client and server)
- Database queries and connection operations
- Message queue publishing and consumption
- External API calls and file operations

**Custom Instrumentation**:
- Business process boundaries and major operations
- Cache operations and performance-critical sections
- Authentication and authorization decisions
- Error handling and recovery operations

### Trace Sampling Strategy

**Sampling Rules**:
- **Production**: 1% sampling for normal operations, 100% for errors
- **Staging**: 10% sampling for performance testing
- **Development**: 100% sampling for debugging
- **High-Value Operations**: Always sample authentication, payments, critical business processes
